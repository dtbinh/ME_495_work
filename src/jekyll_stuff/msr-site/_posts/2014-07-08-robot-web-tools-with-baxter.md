title:              Robot Web Tools with Baxter
demo:               https://github.com/jonrovira/robot_web_tools
requirements:       [ros-hydro-ros-base (basic ROS installation), 
                    ros-hydro-rosbridge-server (rosbridge_server),
                    mjpeg_server,
                    Rethink Robotics Baxter robot,
                    Properly configured workspace for Baxter robot]
overview:           Demonstrate the capabilities of Robot Web Tools, particularly when 
                    interfacing it with Rethink Robotics' Baxter robot. The included demo contains code to publish a simple message to a ROS Topic, stream one of Baxter's camera feeds, and control Baxter's left arm, al via a web browser.
